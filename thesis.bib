  abstract =      {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding
                   their structure can facilitate a mechanistic
                   understanding of their function. Through an enormous
                   experimental effort1--4, the structures of around
                   100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but
                   this represents a small fraction of the billions of
                   known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is
                   bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking
                   effort required to determine a single protein
                   structure. Accurate computational approaches are
                   needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale
                   structural bioinformatics. Predicting the
                   three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt
                   based solely on its amino acid sequence---the
                   structure prediction component of the `protein
                   folding problem'8---has been an important open
                   research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite
                   recent progress10--14, existing methods fall
                   far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no
                   homologous structure is available. Here we provide
                   the first computational method that can regularly
                   predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even
                   in cases in which no similar structure is known. We
                   validated an entirely redesigned version of our
                   neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the
                   challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein
                   Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating
                   accuracy competitive with experimental structures in
                   a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other
                   methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold
                   is a novel machine learning approach that
                   incorporates physical and biological knowledge about
                   protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence
                   alignments, into the design of the deep learning
                   algorithm.},

                   applications in protein modelling and design2--6.
                   Here we describe our AlphaFold\,3 model with a
                   substantially updated diffusion-based architecture

                   greater accuracy for protein--ligand interactions

                   tertiary structures determined by crystallography and
                   by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is reported.
                   The expectation is that any consistent differences
                   between the derived atomic models could provide
                   insights into variations in side-chain packing that
                   result from differences in specimens prepared for
                   analysis between these two methods. By computing an
                   atomic packing score, which provides a quantitative
                   measure of clustering of side-chain atoms in the core
                   of the tertiary structures, it is found that, in
                   general, for structures determined by cryo-EM, side
                   chains are more dispersed than in structures
                   determined by X-ray crystallography over a similar
                   resolution range. This trend is also observed in the
                   packing comparison at subunit interfaces. Similar
                   trends were observed in the packing comparison at the
                   core of tertiary structures of the same proteins
                   determined by both X-ray and cryo-EM methods. It is
                   proposed here that the reduced dispersion of side
                   chains in protein crystals could be due to some level
                   of dehydration in 3D crystals prepared for X-ray
                   crystallography and also because the higher rate of
                   freezing of protein samples for cryo-EM may enable
                   preservation of a more native conformation.},

                   References 26 During the past decade charge-coupled
                   device (CCD) detectors have increasingly become the
                   preferred choice of medium for recording data in the
                   electron microscope. The CCD detector itself can be
                   likened to a new type of television camera with
                   superior properties, which makes it an ideal detector
                   for recording very low exposure images. The success
                   of CCD detectors for electron microscopy, however,
                   also relies on a number of other factors, which
                   include its fast response, low noise electronics, the
                   ease of interfacing them to the electron microscope,
                   and the improvements in computing that have made
                   possible the storage and processing of large images.
                   CCD detectors have already begun to be routinely used
                   in a number of important biological applications such
                   as tomography of cellular organelles (reviewed by
                   Baumeister, 1999), where the resolution requirements
                   are relatively modest. However, in most high-
                   resolution microscopic applications, especially where
                   the goal of the microscopy is to obtain structural
                   information at near-atomic resolution, photographic
                   film has continued to remain the medium of choice.
                   With the increasing interest and demand for
                   high-throughput structure determination of important
                   macromolecular assemblies, it is clearly important to
                   have tools for electronic data collection that bypass
                   the slow and tedious process of processing images
                   recorded on photographic film. In this review, we
                   present an analysis of the potential of CCD-based
                   detectors to fully replace photographic film for

                   just emerging as a practical method when Richard
                   Henderson proposed that we should teach an EMBO
                   course on the new technique. The request seemed to
                   come too early because at that moment the method
                   looked more like a laboratory game than a useful
                   tool. However, during the months which ellapsed
                   before the start of the course, several of the major
                   difficulties associated with electron microscopy of
                   vitrified specimens found surprisingly elegant
                   solutions or simply became non-existent. The course
                   could therefore take place under favourable
                   circumstances in the summer of 1983. It was repeated
                   the following years and cryo-electron microscopy
                   spread rapidly. Since that time, water, which was
                   once the arch enemy of all electronmicroscopists,
                   became what it always was in nature -- an integral
                   part of biological matter and a beautiful substance.},

                   to anisotropic map resolution and impeding structure
                   determination. Tilting the specimen stage during data
                   collection is a generalizable solution but has
                   historically led to substantial resolution
                   attenuation. Here, we develop updated data collection
                   and image processing workflows and demonstrate, using
                   multiple specimens, that resolution attenuation is
                   negligible or significantly reduced across tilt
                   angles. Reconstructions with and without the stage
                   tilted as high as 60{$^\circ$} are virtually

                   framework that allows cryo-EM practitioners to define

                   results reinforce the utility of employing stage tilt

                   preferred method for resolving protein structures.
                   Low signal-to-noise (SNR) in cryoEM images reduces
                   the confidence and throughput of structure
                   determination during several steps of data
                   processing, resulting in impediments such as missing
                   particle orientations. Denoising cryoEM images can
                   not only improve downstream analysis but also
                   accelerate the time-consuming data collection process
                   by allowing lower electron dose micrographs to be
                   used for analysis. Here, we present Topaz-Denoise, a
                   deep learning method for reliably and rapidly
                   increasing the SNR of cryoEM images and cryoET
                   tomograms. By training on a dataset composed of
                   thousands of micrographs collected across a wide
                   range of imaging conditions, we are able to learn
                   models capturing the complexity of the cryoEM image
                   formation process. The general model we present is
                   able to denoise new datasets without additional
                   training. Denoising with this model improves
                   micrograph interpretability, enabling us to solve the
                   first 3D single particle closed and partially open
                   structures of clustered protocadherin, an elongated
                   particle with previously-elusive views. We then show
                   for the first time that low dose collection, enabled
                   by Topaz-Denoise, improves downstream analysis in
                   addition to reducing data collection time. We also
                   present the first general 3D denoising model for
                   cryoET. Topaz-Denoise and pre-trained general models
                   are now included in Topaz. We expect that
                   Topaz-Denoise will be of broad utility to the cryoEM
                   community for improving micrograph and tomogram

                   applied to cryo-TEM data. We describe our proposed

                   cryo-TEM projections and whole cryo-tomographic image
                   volumes. Our proposed restoration method dramatically
                   increases contrast in cryo-TEM images, which improves
                   the interpretability of the acquired data.
                   Furthermore we show that automated downstream
                   processing on restored image data, demonstrated on a

                   complexes. Until recently, cryo-electron microscopy
                   (cryo-EM) has been applied to understand molecular
                   organization in either highly purified, isolated
                   biomolecules or in situ . An emerging field is
                   developing, bridging the gap between the two
                   approaches, and focuses on studying molecular
                   organization in native cell extracts. This field has
                   demonstrated its potential by resolving the structure
                   of fungal fatty acid synthase (FAS) at 4.7 {\AA}
                   [Fourier shell correlation (FSC)\,=\,0.143]; FAS was
                   not only less than 50\% enriched, but also retained
                   higher-order binders, previously unknown. Although
                   controversial in the sense that the lysis step might
                   introduce artifacts, cell extracts preserve aspects
                   of cellular function. In addition, cell extracts are
                   accessible, besides cryo-EM, to modern proteomic
                   methods, chemical cross-linking, network biology and
                   biophysical modeling. We expect that automation in
                   imaging cell extracts, along with the integration of
                   molecular/cell biology approaches, will provide
                   remarkable achievements in the study of
                   closer-to-life biomolecular states of pronounced
                   biotechnological and medical importance. Such steps
                   will, eventually, bring us a step closer to the
                   biophysical description of cellular processes in an

                   slice theorem or Fourier slice theorem in two
                   dimensions states that the results of the following
                   two calculations are equal: Take a two-dimensional
                   function f(r), project (e.g. using the Radon
                   transform) it onto a (one-dimensional) line, and do a
                   Fourier transform of that projection. Take that same
                   function, but do a two-dimensional Fourier transform
                   first, and then slice it through its origin, which is
                   parallel to the projection line. In operator terms,
                   if F1 and F2 are the 1- and 2-dimensional Fourier
                   transform operators mentioned above, P1 is the
                   projection operator (which projects a 2-D function
                   onto a 1-D line), S1 is a slice operator (which
                   extracts a 1-D central slice from a function), then F

                   F\_\{1\}P\_\{1\}=S\_\{1\}F\_\{2\}.\} This idea can be
                   extended to higher dimensions. This theorem is used,
                   for example, in the analysis of medical CT scans
                   where a "projection" is an x-ray image of an internal
                   organ. The Fourier transforms of these images are
                   seen to be slices through the Fourier transform of
                   the 3-dimensional density of the internal organ, and
                   these slices can be interpolated to build up a
                   complete Fourier transform of that density. The
                   inverse Fourier transform is then used to recover the
                   3-dimensional density of the object. This technique
                   was first derived by Ronald N. Bracewell in 1956 for
                   a radio-astronomy problem.},

  abstract =      {Dynamo is a new software package for subtomogram
                   averaging of cryo Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) data
                   with three main goals: first, Dynamo allows
                   user-transparent adaptation to a variety of
                   high-performance computing platforms such as GPUs or
                   CPU clusters. Second, Dynamo implements
                   user-friendliness through GUI interfaces and
                   scripting resources. Third, Dynamo offers
                   user-flexibility through a plugin API. Besides the
                   alignment and averaging procedures, Dynamo includes
                   native tools for visualization and analysis of
                   results and data, as well as support for third party
                   visualization software, such as Chimera UCSF or
                   EMAN2. As a demonstration of these functionalities,
                   we studied bacterial flagellar motors and showed
                   automatically detected classes with absent and
                   present C-rings. Subtomogram averaging is a common
                   task in current cryo-ET pipelines, which requires
                   extensive computational resources and follows a
                   well-established workflow. However, due to the data
                   diversity, many existing packages offer slight
                   variations of the same algorithm to improve results.
                   One of the main purposes behind Dynamo is to provide
                   explicit tools to allow the user the insertion of
                   custom designed procedures -- or plugins -- to
                   replace or complement the native algorithms in the
                   different steps of the processing pipeline for
                   subtomogram averaging without the burden of handling
                   parallelization. Custom scripts that implement new
                   approaches devised by the user are integrated into
                   the Dynamo data management system, so that they can
                   be controlled by the GUI or the scripting capacities.
                   Dynamo executables do not require licenses for third
                   party commercial software. Sources, executables and
                   documentation are freely distributed on

                   (cryo-EM) images allows structure determination of
                   macromolecular complexes. But when these molecules
                   adopt many different conformations, traditional image
                   processing approaches often lead to blurred
                   reconstructions. By considering complexes to be
                   comprised of multiple, independently moving rigid
                   bodies, multi-body refinement in RELION enables
                   structure determination of highly flexible complexes,
                   while at the same time providing a characterization
                   of the motions in the complex. Here, we describe how

                   the absolute hand of the structure of a protein or
                   assembly determined by single-particle electron
                   microscopy. The procedure requires a pair of
                   micrographs of the same particle field recorded at
                   two tilt angles of a single tilt-axis specimen holder
                   together with the three-dimensional map whose hand is
                   being determined. For orientations determined from
                   particles on one micrograph using the map, the
                   agreement (average phase residual) between particle
                   images on the second micrograph and map projections
                   is determined for all possible choices of tilt angle
                   and axis. Whether the agreement is better at the
                   known tilt angle and axis of the microscope or its
                   inverse indicates whether the map is of correct or
                   incorrect hand. An increased discrimination of
                   correct from incorrect hand (free hand difference),
                   as well as accurate identification of the known
                   values for the tilt angle and axis, can be used as
                   targets for rapidly optimizing the search or
                   refinement procedures used to determine particle
                   orientations. Optimized refinement reduces the
                   tendency for the model to match noise in a single
                   image, thus improving the accuracy of the orientation
                   determination and therefore the quality of the
                   resulting map. The hand determination and refinement
                   optimization procedure is applied to image pairs of
                   the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) catalytic
                   core of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from
                   Bacillus stearothermophilus taken by low-dose
                   electron cryomicroscopy. Structure factor amplitudes
                   of a three-dimensional map of the E2 catalytic core
                   obtained by averaging untilted images of 3667
                   icosahedral particles are compared to a scattering
                   reference using a Guinier plot. A noise-dependent
                   structure factor weight is derived and used in
                   conjunction with a temperature factor (B=-1000{\AA}2)
                   to restore high-resolution contrast without
                   amplifying noise and to visualize molecular features

                   provides a unified optimization framework for both

                   By combining information from the cryo-EM map with
                   information from protein sequence and structure in a
                   single graph neural network, ModelAngelo builds
                   atomic models for proteins that are of similar
                   quality to those generated by human experts. For
                   nucleotides, ModelAngelo builds backbones with
                   similar accuracy to those built by humans. By using
                   its predicted amino acid probabilities for each
                   residue in hidden Markov model sequence searches,
                   ModelAngelo outperforms human experts in the

                   the cellular molecular components are fractionated
                   and purified before being studied individually. This
                   `divide and conquer' approach has been highly
                   successful. However, awareness has grown in recent
                   years that biological functions can rarely be
                   attributed to individual macromolecules. Most
                   cellular functions arise from their concerted action,
                   and there is thus a need for methods enabling
                   structural studies performed in situ, ideally in
                   unperturbed cellular environments. Cryo-electron

                   preservation that is physically possible to achieve.

                   Freon. The formation of large ice crystals is
                   prevented in tissue blocks up to 0.5 mm thick; deep

                   required for single-axis tomography precludes its
                   application to most beam-labile specimens. However,
                   Hegerl and Hoppe have pointed out that the total dose
                   required to achieve statistical significance for each
                   voxel of a computed 3D reconstruction is the same as
                   that required to obtain a single 2D image of that
                   isolated voxel, at the same level of statistical
                   significance. Thus a statistically significant 3D
                   image can be computed from statistically
                   insignificant projections, as long as the total dose
                   that is distributed among these projections is high
                   enough that it would have resulted in a statistically
                   significant projection, if applied to only one image.
                   We have tested this critical theorem by simulating
                   the tomographic reconstruction of a realistic 3D
                   model created from an electron micrograph. The
                   simulations verify the basic conclusions of the
                   theorem and extend its validity to the experimentally
                   more realistic conditions of high absorption,
                   signal-dependent noise, varying specimen contrast and
                   missing angular range. Individual projections in the
                   series of fractionated-dose images could be aligned
                   by cross-correlation because they contained
                   significant information derived from the summation of
                   features from different depths in the structure. This
                   latter information is generally not useful for
                   structural interpretation prior to 3D reconstruction,
                   owing to the complexity of most specimens
                   investigated by single-axis tomography. These results
                   demonstrate that it is feasible to use single-axis
                   tomography with soft X-ray and electron microscopy of
                   frozen-hydrated specimens.},

                   detailed structures of repeating features can be
                   resolved. CryoET data is collected as a series of
                   images of the sample from different tilt angles; this
                   is performed by physically rotating the sample in the

                   the images are collected, and the order in which they
                   are collected, together are called the tilt-scheme.
                   Here we describe a ``dose-symmetric tilt-scheme''
                   that begins at low tilt and then alternates between

                   the tilt-scheme in combination with further

                   thresholds on acceptable drift and improving focus

                   homogeneity, but this process is complicated by the
                   problems of poor SNR and missing data, the factors
                   that led to consideration of multiple subvolumes in
                   the first place. Here, we describe a new approach to
                   clustering and variance mapping in the face of these
                   difficulties. The combined subvolume is taken as an
                   estimate of the true subvolume, and the effect of
                   missing data is computed for individual subvolumes.
                   Clustering and variance mapping then proceed based on
                   differences between expected and observed subvolumes.
                   We show that this new method is faster and more
                   accurate than two current, widely used techniques.},

                   processing for subtomogram averaging is specific and

                   three dimensional nature and anisotropic resolution.
                   Here, we streamline data processing for subtomogram
                   averaging by introducing an archiving system, Dynamo
                   Catalogue. This system manages tomographic data from
                   multiple tomograms and allows visual feedback during
                   all processing steps, including particle picking,
                   extraction, alignment and classification. The file

                   commands, database queries and a set of GUIs give the
                   user versatile control over the process. Here, we
                   introduce a set of geometric tools that streamline
                   particle picking from simple (filaments, spheres,
                   tubes, vesicles) and complex geometries (arbitrary 2D
                   surfaces, rare instances on proteins with geometric
                   restrictions, and 2D and 3D crystals). Advanced
                   functionality, such as manual alignment and
                   subboxing, is useful when initial templates are

                   imaged in three-dimensions in their native
                   environments. Cryo-electron tomograms are
                   reconstructed from projection images taken at defined
                   tilt-angles. In order to recover high-resolution
                   information from cryo-electron tomograms, it is
                   necessary to measure and correct for the contrast
                   transfer function (CTF) of the microscope. Most
                   commonly, this is performed using protocols that
                   approximate the sample as a two-dimensional (2D)
                   plane. This approximation accounts for differences in
                   defocus and therefore CTF across the tilted sample.
                   It does not account for differences in defocus of
                   objects at different heights within the sample;
                   instead, a 3D approach is required. Currently
                   available approaches for 3D-CTF correction are
                   computationally expensive and have not been widely
                   implemented. Here we simulate the benefits of 3D-CTF
                   correction for high-resolution subtomogram averaging,
                   and present a user-friendly,

                   NovaCTF, that is compatible with standard tomogram
                   reconstruction workflows in IMOD. We validate the
                   approach on synthetic data and test it using
                   subtomogram averaging of real data. Consistent with
                   our simulations, we find that 3D-CTF correction
                   allows high-resolution structures to be obtained with
                   much smaller subtomogram averaging datasets than are
                   required using 2D-CTF. We also show that using
                   equivalent dataset sizes, 3D-CTF correction can be
                   used to obtain higher-resolution structures. We

                   However, anisotropic resolution arising from the
                   intrinsic ``missing-wedge'' problem has presented
                   major challenges in visualization and interpretation
                   of tomograms. Here, we have developed IsoNet, a deep
                   learning-based software package that iteratively
                   reconstructs the missing-wedge information and
                   increases signal-to-noise ratio, using the knowledge
                   learned from raw tomograms. Without the need for
                   sub-tomogram averaging, Isonet generates tomograms
                   with significantly reduced resolution anisotropy.
                   Applications of IsoNet to three representative types
                   of cryoET data demonstrate greatly improved
                   structural interpretability: resolving lattice
                   defects in immature HIV particles, establishing
                   architecture of the paraflagellar rod in Eukaryotic
                   flagella, and identifying heptagon-containing
                   clathrin cages inside a neuronal synapse of cultured
                   cells. Therefore, by overcoming two fundamental
                   limitations of cryoET, IsoNet enables functional
                   interpretation of cellular tomograms without
                   sub-tomogram averaging. Its application to
                   high-resolution cellular tomograms should also help
                   identify differently oriented complexes of the same
                   kind for near-atomic resolution sub-tomogram
                   averaging.},

                   denoising and compensating the missing wedge
                   information. The application in dynamic nucleosomes,
                   presenting either in the form of individual particles
                   or in the context of cryo-FIB nuclei section,
                   indicates that REST has the capability to reveal
                   different conformations of target macromolecules
                   without subtomogram averaging. Moreover, REST
                   noticeably improves the reliability of particle
                   picking. These advantages enable REST to be a
                   powerful tool for the straightforward interpretation
                   of target macromolecules by visual inspection of the
                   density and of a broad range of other applications in
                   cryo-ET, such as segmentation, particle picking, and

                   tomography (cryo-ET). While several tools exist for
                   visualisation and annotation of cryo-ET data, they
                   are often integrated as part of monolithic processing
                   pipelines, or focused on a specific task and offering
                   limited reusability and extensibility. With each

                   tools tailored to address specific challenges,
                   seamless integration between available pipelines is
                   often a difficult task. As part of the effort to

                   ecosystem towards a more collaborative and modular
                   approach, we developed blik, an open-source napari
                   plugin for visualisation and annotation of cryo-ET
                   data (source code: https://github.com/brisvag/blik).
                   blik offers fast, interactive, and user-friendly 3D
                   visualisation thanks to napari, and is built with
                   extensibility and modularity at the core. Data is
                   handled and exposed through well-established
                   scientific Python libraries such as numpy arrays and
                   pandas dataframes. Reusable components (such as data
                   structures, file read/write, and annotation tools)
                   are developed as independent Python libraries to
                   encourage reuse and community contribution. By easily
                   integrating with established image analysis
                   tools---even outside of the cryo-ET world---blik
                   provides a versatile platform for interacting with
                   cryo-ET data. On top of core visualisation
                   features---interactive and simultaneous visualisation
                   of tomograms, particle picks, and
                   segmentations---blik provides an interface for
                   interactive tools such as manual, surface-based and
                   filament-based particle picking, and image
                   segmentation, as well as simple filtering tools.
                   Additional self-contained napari plugins developed as
                   part of this work also implement interactive plotting
                   and selection based on particle features, and label
                   interpolation for easier segmentation. Finally, we
                   highlight the differences with existing software and

                   averaging to generate improved 3D density maps of

                   resolution potential. Many factors can make CTF
                   correction for cryoSPT challenging, such as lack of
                   eucentricity of the specimen stage, inherent low dose
                   per image, specimen charging, beam-induced specimen

                   specimen tilting and from unpredictable ice thickness
                   variations. Current CTF correction methods for cryoET
                   make at least one of the following assumptions: that
                   the defocus at the center of the image is the same
                   across the images of a tiltseries, that the particles
                   all lie at the same Z-height in the embedding ice,

                   microscopy (cryoEM) grid and/or the carbon support
                   are flat. These experimental conditions are not

                   growing technique with increasing importance in
                   structural biology. The computational aspect of STA
                   is very complex and depends on a large number of
                   variables. We noticed a lack of detailed guides for
                   STA processing. Also, current publications in this
                   field often lack a documentation that is practical
                   enough to reproduce the results with reasonable
                   effort, which is necessary for the scientific
                   community to grow. We therefore provide a complete,

                   that covers all aspects of particle picking and
                   particle alignment in STA. The command line--based

                   pipeline can be streamlined and automatized for
                   increased throughput. This protocol is aimed at users

                   Dynamo by modifying and expanding the given pipeline.

                   In-depth analysis of macromolecule populations
                   depicted in tomograms requires identification of
                   subtomograms corresponding to putative particles,
                   averaging of subtomograms to enhance their signal,
                   and classification to capture the structural
                   variations among them. Here, we introduce the
                   open-source platform PyTom that unifies standard
                   tomogram processing steps in a python toolbox. For
                   subtomogram averaging, we implemented an adaptive
                   adjustment of scoring and sampling that clearly
                   improves the resolution of averages compared to
                   static strategies. Furthermore, we present a novel
                   stochastic classification method that yields
                   significantly more accurate classification results
                   than two deterministic approaches in simulations. We
                   demonstrate that the PyTom workflow yields faithful

                   and experimental subtomograms of ribosomes and

                   macromolecules in their cellular context. To detect
                   macromolecules in tomograms, template matching (TM)
                   is often used, which uses 3D models that are often
                   reliable for substantial parts of the macromolecules.
                   However, the extent of rotational searches in
                   particle detection has not been investigated due to
                   computational limitations. Here, we provide a GPU
                   implementation of TM as part of the PyTOM software
                   package, which drastically speeds up the
                   orientational search and allows for sampling beyond
                   the Crowther criterion within a feasible timeframe.
                   We quantify the improvements in sensitivity and
                   false-discovery rate for the examples of ribosome
                   identification and detection. Sampling at the
                   Crowther criterion, which was effectively impossible
                   with CPU implementations due to the extensive
                   computation times, allows for automated extraction
                   with high sensitivity. Consequently, we also show
                   that an extensive angular sample renders 3D TM
                   sensitive to the local alignment of tilt series and
                   damage induced by focused ion beam milling. With this

                   other software packages that support more refined
                   subtomogram-averaging workflows. The automated
                   classification of ribosomes by TM with appropriate
                   angular sampling on locally corrected tomograms has a
                   sufficiently low false-discovery rate, allowing for
                   it to be directly used for high-resolution averaging
                   and adequate sensitivity to reveal polysome

                   to visualize how the intricate thylakoid network
                   organizes these protein complexes to finely tune the
                   photosynthetic reactions. Previously, we used in situ

                   Segmentation of structural components present in 3D
                   images (tomograms) is often necessary for their
                   interpretation. However, it is severely hampered by a
                   number of factors that are inherent to electron
                   tomography (e.g. noise, low contrast, distortion).
                   Thus, there is a need for new and improved
                   computational methods to facilitate this challenging
                   task. In this work, we present a new method for
                   membrane segmentation that is based on anisotropic
                   propagation of the local structural information using
                   the tensor voting algorithm. The local structure at
                   each voxel is then refined according to the
                   information received from other voxels. Because
                   voxels belonging to the same membrane have coherent
                   structural information, the underlying global
                   structure is strengthened. In this way, local
                   information is easily integrated at a global scale to
                   yield segmented structures. This method performs well
                   under low signal-to-noise ratio typically found in
                   tomograms of vitrified samples under cryo-tomography
                   conditions and can bridge gaps present on membranes.
                   The performance of the method is demonstrated by
                   applications to tomograms of different biological
                   samples and by quantitative comparison with standard
                   template matching procedure.},

                   positions are extracted by a clustering algorithm.
                   Incorporating rotational subvolume normalization and
                   using a tiny receptive field simplify the task of
                   protein detection and thus facilitate the network
                   training. Results MemBrain requires only a small
                   quantity of training labels and achieves excellent
                   performance with only a single annotated membrane (F1
                   score: 0.88). A detailed evaluation shows that our
                   fully trained pipeline outperforms existing classical
                   computer vision-based and CNN-based approaches by a
                   large margin (F1 score: 0.92 vs. max. 0.63).
                   Furthermore, in addition to protein center positions,
                   MemBrain can determine protein orientations, which
                   has not been implemented by any existing CNN-based
                   method to date. We also show that a pre-trained
                   MemBrain program generalizes to tomograms acquired
                   using different cryo-ET methods and depicting
                   different types of cells. Conclusions MemBrain is a
                   powerful and label-efficient tool for the detection
                   of membrane protein complexes in cryo-ET data, with
                   the potential to be used in a wide range of
                   biological studies. It is generalizable to various
                   kinds of tomograms, making it possible to use
                   pretrained models for different tasks. Its efficiency
                   in terms of required annotations also allows rapid
                   training and fine-tuning of models. The corresponding

                   1) MemBrain-seg, which provides automated membrane
                   segmentation, 2) MemBrain-pick, which provides
                   automated picking of particles along segmented
                   membranes, and 3) MemBrain-stats, which provides
                   quantitative statistics of particle distributions and
                   membrane morphometrics. This initial version of the
                   manuscript is focused on the beta release of
                   MemBrain-seg, which combines iterative training with
                   diverse data and specialized Fourier-based data
                   augmentations. These augmentations are specifically
                   designed to enhance the tool's adaptability to a
                   variety of tomographic data and address common
                   challenges in cryo-ET analysis. A key feature of
                   MemBrain-seg is the implementation of the
                   Surface-Dice loss function, which improves the
                   network's focus on membrane connectivity and allows
                   for the effective incorporation of manual annotations
                   from different sources. This function is beneficial
                   in handling the variability inherent in membrane
                   structures and annotations. Our ongoing collaboration
                   with the cryo-ET community plays an important role in
                   continually improving MemBrain v2 with a wide array
                   of training data. This collaborative approach ensures
                   that MemBrain v2 remains attuned to the field's
                   needs, enhancing its robustness and generalizability

  abstract =      {Curvature is a fundamental morphological descriptor
                   of cellular membranes. Cryo-electron tomography
                   (cryo-ET) is particularly well-suited to visualize
                   and analyze membrane morphology in a close-to-native
                   state and molecular resolution. However, current
                   curvature estimation methods cannot be applied
                   directly to membrane segmentations in cryo-ET, as
                   these methods cannot cope with some of the artifacts
                   introduced during image acquisition and membrane
                   segmentation, such as quantization noise and open
                   borders. Here, we developed and implemented a Python
                   package for membrane curvature estimation from
                   tomogram segmentations, which we named PyCurv. From a
                   membrane segmentation, a signed surface (triangle
                   mesh) is first extracted. The triangle mesh is then
                   represented by a graph, which facilitates finding
                   neighboring triangles and the calculation of geodesic
                   distances necessary for local curvature estimation.
                   PyCurv estimates curvature based on tensor voting.
                   Beside curvatures, this algorithm also provides
                   robust estimations of surface normals and principal
                   directions. We tested PyCurv and three
                   well-established methods on benchmark surfaces and
                   biological data. This revealed the superior
                   performance of PyCurv not only for cryo-ET, but also
                   for data generated by other techniques such as light
                   microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging.
                   Altogether, PyCurv is a versatile open-source
                   software to reliably estimate curvature of membranes
                   and other surfaces in a wide variety of
                   applications.},

                   three-dimensional reconstructions of organelles in
                   their native cellular environment at subnanometer
                   resolution. However, quantifying ultrastructural
                   features of pleomorphic organelles in three
                   dimensions is challenging, as is defining the
                   significance of observed changes induced by specific
                   cellular perturbations. To address this challenge, we
                   established a semiautomated workflow to segment
                   organellar membranes and reconstruct their underlying
                   surface geometry in cryo-ET. To complement this
                   workflow, we developed an open-source suite of
                   ultrastructural quantifications, integrated into a
                   single pipeline called the surface morphometrics
                   pipeline. This pipeline enables rapid modeling of
                   complex membrane structures and allows detailed
                   mapping of inter- and intramembrane spacing,
                   curvedness, and orientation onto reconstructed
                   membrane meshes, highlighting subtle organellar
                   features that are challenging to detect in three
                   dimensions and allowing for statistical comparison
                   across many organelles. To demonstrate the advantages
                   of this approach, we combine cryo-ET with
                   cryo-fluorescence microscopy to correlate bulk
                   mitochondrial network morphology (i.e., elongated
                   versus fragmented) with membrane ultrastructure of
                   individual mitochondria in the presence and absence
                   of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Using our
                   pipeline, we demonstrate ER stress promotes adaptive
                   remodeling of ultrastructural features of
                   mitochondria including spacing between the inner and
                   outer membranes, local curvedness of the inner
                   membrane, and spacing between mitochondrial cristae.
                   We show that differences in membrane ultrastructure
                   correlate to mitochondrial network morphologies,
                   suggesting that these two remodeling events are
                   coupled. Our pipeline offers opportunities for
                   quantifying changes in membrane ultrastructure on a
                   single-cell level using cryo-ET, opening new
                   opportunities to define changes in ultrastructural
                   features induced by diverse types of cellular
                   perturbations.},

                   environment by cryogenic electron tomography
                   (cryo-ET). Yet, analyzing membrane proteins and their
                   organization is challenging due to their small sizes
                   and the need to consider local context constrained to
                   the membrane surface. Results To interactively
                   visualize, annotate, and analyze proteins in cellular
                   context from cryo-ET data, we have developed
                   Surforama, a Python package and napari plugin. For
                   interactive visualization of membrane proteins in
                   tomograms, Surforama renders the local densities

                   Suforama additionally provides tools to annotate and
                   analyze particles on the membrane surfaces. Finally,
                   for compatibility with other tools in the cryo-ET

                   bacteria to allow visualization of fundamental
                   processes in time and space, and their use in
                   synchronous populations of cells, has resulted in a
                   dramatic increase in our understanding of cell
                   division and its regulation in these tiny cells. The
                   first stage of cell division is the formation of a Z
                   ring, composed of a polymerized tubulin-like protein,
                   FtsZ, at the division site precisely at midcell.
                   Several membrane-associated division proteins are
                   then recruited to this ring to form a complex, the
                   divisome, which causes invagination of the cell
                   envelope layers to form a division septum. The Z ring
                   marks the future division site, and the timing of
                   assembly and positioning of this structure are
                   important in determining where and when division will
                   take place in the cell. Z ring assembly is controlled
                   by many factors including negative regulatory
                   mechanisms such as Min and nucleoid occlusion that
                   influence Z ring positioning and FtsZ accessory
                   proteins that bind to FtsZ directly and modulate its
                   polymerization behavior. The replication status of
                   the cell also influences the positioning of the Z
                   ring, which may allow the tight coordination between
                   DNA replication and cell division required to produce
                   two identical newborn cells.},

  abstract =      {An important question for bacterial cell division is
                   how the invaginating septum can overcome the turgor
                   force generated by the high osmolarity of the
                   cytoplasm. I suggest that it may not need to. Several
                   studies in Gram-negative bacteria have shown that the
                   periplasm is isoosmolar with the cytoplasm. Indirect
                   evidence suggests that this is also true for
                   Gram-positive bacteria. In this case the invagination
                   of the septum takes place within the uniformly high
                   osmotic pressure environment, and does not have to
                   fight turgor pressure. A related question is how the
                   V-shaped constriction of Gram-negative bacteria
                   relates to the plate-like septum of Gram-positive

                   synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan
                   (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the
                   daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential
                   process has been limited by the lack of native
                   three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we
                   apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography
                   (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize
                   the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis
                   dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia
                   coli. We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that
                   fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with
                   strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the
                   septal architecture and mode of division can be
                   modified to more closely resemble that of other
                   Gram-negative (Caulobacter crescentus) or
                   Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria,
                   suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the
                   formation of different septal morphologies. Finally,
                   analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation
                   ({$\Delta$}envC {$\Delta$}nlpD) showed that cell wall
                   remodelling affects the placement and stability of
                   the cytokinetic ring. Taken together, our results
                   support a model in which competition between the cell
                   elongation and division machineries determines the
                   shape of cell constrictions and the poles they form.
                   They also highlight how the activity of the division
                   system can be modulated to help generate the diverse
                   array of shapes observed in the bacterial domain.},

                   a compilation of the complex architectural features
                   of staphylococcal cell walls and of some of their
                   unusual morphogenetic traits including the
                   utilization of murosomes and two different mechanisms
                   of cell separation. Knowledge of these electron
                   microscopic findings may serve as a prerequisite for
                   a better understanding of the sophisticated events
                   which lead to penicillin-induced death. For more than
                   50 years there have been controversial disputes about
                   the mechanisms by which penicillin kills bacteria.
                   Many hypotheses have tried to explain this fatal
                   event biochemically and mainly via bacteriolysis.
                   However, indications that penicillin-induced death of
                   staphylococci results from overall biochemical
                   defects or from a fatal attack of bacterial cell
                   walls by bacteriolytic murein hydrolases were not
                   been found. Rather, penicillin, claimed to trigger
                   the activity of murein hydrolases, impaired autolytic
                   wall enzymes of staphylococci. Electron microscopic
                   investigations have meanwhile shown that
                   penicillin-mediated induction of seemingly minute
                   cross wall mistakes is the very reason for this
                   killing. Such ``morphogenetic death'' taking place at
                   predictable cross wall sites and at a predictable
                   time is based on the initiation of normal cell
                   separations in those staphylococci in which the
                   completion of cross walls had been prevented by local
                   penicillin-mediated impairment of the distribution of
                   newly synthesized peptidoglycan; this death occurs
                   because the high internal pressure of the protoplast
                   abruptly kills such cells via ejection of some
                   cytoplasm during attempted cell separation. An
                   analogous fatal onset of cell partition is considered
                   to take place without involvement of a detectable
                   quantity of autolytic wall enzymes (``mechanical cell
                   separation''). The most prominent feature of
                   penicillin, the disintegration of bacterial cells via
                   bacteriolysis, is shown to represent only a
                   postmortem process resulting from shrinkage of dead
                   cells and perturbation of the cytoplasmic membrane.
                   Several schematic drawings have been included in this
                   review to facilitate an understanding of the complex
                   morphogenetic events.},

                   electron microscopy of thin sections and on sample
                   preparation. Freezing of cells into a matrix of
                   amorphous ice (i.e., vitrification) results in
                   optimal specimen preservation and allows the
                   observation of cell envelope boundary layers in their
                   (frozen) hydrated state. In this report,
                   cryo-transmission electron microscopy of
                   frozen-hydrated sections of Staphylococcus aureus D2C
                   was used to examine cell envelope organization. A
                   bipartite wall was positioned above the plasma
                   membrane and consisted of a 16-nm low-density inner
                   wall zone (IWZ), followed by a 19-nm high-density
                   outer wall zone (OWZ). Observation of plasmolyzed
                   cells, which were used to artificially separate the
                   membrane from the wall, showed membrane vesicles
                   within the space associated with the IWZ in native
                   cells and a large gap between the membrane and OWZ,
                   suggesting that the IWZ was devoid of a cross-linked
                   polymeric cell wall network. Isolated wall fragments
                   possessed only one zone of high density, with a
                   constant level of density throughout their thickness,
                   as was previously seen with the OWZs of intact cells.
                   These results strongly indicate that the IWZ
                   represents a periplasmic space, composed mostly of
                   soluble low-density constituents confined between the
                   plasma membrane and OWZ, and that the OWZ represents
                   the peptidoglycan-teichoic acid cell wall network
                   with its associated proteins. Cell wall
                   differentiation was also seen at the septum of
                   dividing cells. Here, two high-density zones were
                   sandwiched between three low-density zones. It
                   appeared that the septum consisted of an extension of
                   the IWZ and OWZ from the outside peripheral wall,
                   plus a low-density middle zone that separated
                   adjacent septal cross walls, which could contribute
                   to cell separation during division.},

                   including the natural orientation of their surface
                   layers. Here, we use this approach to study the fine
                   ultrastructure of the division site, or septum, of
                   Staphylococcus aureus D2C. Frozen-hydrated sections
                   revealed a differentiated cell wall at the septum,
                   showing two high-density regions sandwiched between
                   three low-density zones. The two zones adjacent to
                   the membrane appeared as an extension of the
                   periplasmic space seen in this organism's cell
                   envelope and showed no distinguishing structures
                   within them. Immediately next to these were
                   higher-density zones that corresponded to nascent
                   cross walls of the septum. Unexpectedly, a rather
                   broad low-density zone was seen separating cross
                   walls in the septum. This mid-zone of low density
                   appeared inflated and without visible structures in
                   isolated cell walls, which showed only the
                   high-density zones of the septum. Here, we suggest
                   that frozen-hydrated thin sections have captured a
                   highly fragile septal region, the mid-zone, which
                   results from the dynamic action of autolysis and
                   actively separates daughter cells during division.
                   The two zones next to the membranes are periplasmic
                   spaces. Immediately next to these are the growing

                   the help of this technique, the existence of a
                   periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the
                   thick peptidoglycan layer of the gram-positive
                   bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus
                   was recently shown. This raises questions about the
                   mode of polymerization of peptidoglycan. In the
                   present study, we report the structure of the cell
                   envelope of three gram-positive bacteria (B.
                   subtilis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Enterococcus
                   gallinarum). In the three cases, a previously
                   undescribed granular layer adjacent to the plasma
                   membrane is found in the periplasmic space. In order
                   to better understand how nascent peptidoglycan is
                   incorporated into the mature peptidoglycan, we
                   investigated cellular regions known to represent the
                   sites of cell wall production. Each of these sites
                   possesses a specific structure. We propose a
                   hypothetic model of peptidoglycan polymerization that
                   accommodates these differences: peptidoglycan
                   precursors could be exported from the cytoplasm to
                   the periplasmic space, where they could diffuse until
                   they would interact with the interface between the
                   granular layer and the thick peptidoglycan layer.
                   They could then polymerize with mature peptidoglycan.
                   We report cytoplasmic structures at the E. gallinarum

                   preservation of microbial ultrastructure with
                   traditional methods. Here, we established and
                   validated a super-resolution cryo-correlative light
                   and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) method, and
                   combined it with cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB)
                   milling and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) volume
                   imaging to structurally characterize the bacterium
                   Deinococcus radiodurans. Subsequent cryo-electron
                   tomography (cryo-ET) revealed an unusual diderm cell
                   envelope architecture with a thick layer of
                   peptidoglycan (PG) between the inner and outer
                   membranes, an additional periplasmic layer, and a
                   proteinaceous surface S-layer. Cells grew in tetrads,
                   and division septa were formed by invagination of the
                   inner membrane (IM), followed by a thick layer of PG.
                   Cytoskeletal filaments, FtsA and FtsZ, were observed
                   at the leading edges of constricting septa. Numerous
                   macromolecular complexes were found associated with
                   the cytoplasmic side of the IM. Altogether, our study
                   revealed several unique ultrastructural features of
                   D.~radiodurans cells, opening new lines of
                   investigation into the physiology and evolution of

  abstract =      {The study of sections, freeze-cleaved, and whole-cell
                   preparations of Deinococcus radiodurans supported the
                   contention that septa close assymmetrically and
                   originate from discrete opposing locations on the
                   cell surface. Tetrads and the larger associations
                   (sheets) of cells in some strains were formed by
                   alternate and synchronized divisions in two planes.
                   The polarity initiating the second division in cells
                   of the Sark strain, in particular, was often
                   expressed in slower growing cells before completion
                   of the first division so that the advancing margins
                   of the first septum were diverted towards the nearest
                   new pole; the resulting gap was closed later on, and
                   consequently, the cell compartments of this coccus
                   were in communication for some time after two rounds
                   of nuclear segregation. Freeze cleaving showed that
                   the initial generation of septa involved a short
                   sulcus in the plasma membrane and not a
                   circumferential infolding. The shape and form of the
                   developing septum was inferred from sections but was
                   displayed in whole-cell preparations by a technique
                   which selectively and positively stained a septal
                   component. Positive staining of the septum with
                   uranyl salts was appreciable when the relative
                   stainability of the peripheral wall (mainly
                   peptidoglycan) was reduced by pretreatment with salts
                   of low atomic weight metals (0.01--1.0\%, w/v) such
                   as cobalt, copper, iron, or zinc. Examination of
                   these whole-cell preparations by stereoscopy showed
                   that the septal diaphragm closes as a slit or long
                   oval, and the advancing margin shows curvature
                   towards the next axis of division. The mechanism and
                   exact site of this positive staining was not
                   elucidated; vancomycin blocking of the uncross-linked
                   peptides of peptidogylcan was almost as effective as
                   the transition metal salts as a foretreatment for
                   staining septa.},

                   Growth proceeded at a linear rate sequentially in
                   each dimension. Growth in the second dimension
                   (former width) was initiated slightly before the

                   Penicillin treatment localized presumptive growth
                   zones to the existing septum region. It was suggested
                   that new growth zones were always formed
                   perpendicular to the longitudinal axis created in the

                   specific time windows, through peptidoglycan
                   synthesis and remodelling. Both peptidoglycan
                   hydrolysis and turgor pressure are required during
                   division for reshaping the flat division septum into
                   a curved surface. In this process, the septum
                   generates less than one hemisphere of each daughter

                   asymmetry in the daughter cells. Our results

                   daughters whose cell walls are only connected via a
                   narrow peripheral ring. We found that resolution of
                   this ring occurred within milliseconds (``popping''),
                   without detectable changes in cell volume. The

                   same phylum (Firmicutes) or with similar coccoid
                   shapes as S. aureus, might use a similar mechanically

                   video microscopy to examine cytokinesis in a
                   phylogenetically wide range of species with various
                   cell shapes and sizes. We found that fast
                   mechanically driven DCS is rather rare in the

                   the Macrococcus genus, and we did not observe this
                   division strategy among the Gram-negative
                   Proteobacteria. In contrast, several members of the

                   to rod all undergo fast mechanical DCS during cell
                   division. Most intriguingly, similar fast mechanical
                   DCS was also observed during the sporulation of the
                   actinobacterium Streptomyces venezuelae. IMPORTANCE
                   Much of our knowledge on bacterial cytokinesis comes
                   from studying rod-shaped model organisms such as
                   Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Less is known
                   about variations in this process among different
                   bacterial species. While cell division in many
                   bacteria has been characterized to some extent
                   genetically or biochemically, few species have been
                   examined using video microscopy to uncover the
                   kinetics of cytokinesis and daughter cell separation
                   (DCS). In this work, we found that fast (millisecond)
                   DCS is exhibited by species in two independent clades
                   of Gram-positive bacteria and is particularly
                   prevalent among the Actinobacteria, a diverse group
                   that includes significant pathogens as well as
                   bacteria that generate medically important
                   antibiotics.},

  abstract =      {ABSTRACT Peptidoglycan is a defining feature of the
                   bacterial cell wall. Initially identified as a target
                   of the revolutionary beta-lactam antibiotics,
                   peptidoglycan has become a subject of much interest
                   for its biology, its potential for the discovery of
                   novel antibiotic targets, and its role in infection.
                   Peptidoglycan is a large polymer that forms a
                   mesh-like scaffold around the bacterial cytoplasmic
                   membrane. Peptidoglycan synthesis is vital at several
                   stages of the bacterial cell cycle: for expansion of
                   the scaffold during cell elongation and for formation
                   of a septum during cell division. It is a complex
                   multifactorial process that includes formation of
                   monomeric precursors in the cytoplasm, their
                   transport to the periplasm, and polymerization to
                   form a functional peptidoglycan sacculus. These
                   processes require spatio-temporal regulation for
                   successful assembly of a robust sacculus to protect
                   the cell from turgor and determine cell shape. A
                   century of research has uncovered the fundamentals of
                   peptidoglycan biology, and recent studies employing
                   advanced technologies have shed new light on the
                   molecular interactions that govern peptidoglycan
                   synthesis. Here, we describe the peptidoglycan
                   structure, synthesis, and regulation in rod-shaped
                   bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli , with a few
                   examples from Salmonella and other diverse organisms.
                   We focus on the pathway of peptidoglycan sacculus
                   elongation, with special emphasis on discoveries of
                   the past decade that have shaped our understanding of
                   peptidoglycan biology.},

                   cell wall at the division site. It remains debated,
                   however, whether this cell wall remodeling alone can
                   drive membrane constriction, or if a constrictive
                   force from the tubulin homolog FtsZ is required.
                   Previously, we constructed software (REMODELER 1) to
                   simulate cell wall remodeling during growth. Here, we
                   expanded this software to explore cell wall division
                   (REMODELER 2). We found that simply organizing cell
                   wall synthesis complexes at the midcell is not
                   sufficient to cause invagination, even with the
                   implementation of a make-before-break mechanism, in
                   which new hoops of cell wall are made inside the
                   existing hoops before bonds are cleaved. Division can
                   occur, however, when a constrictive force brings the
                   midcell into a compressed state before new hoops of
                   relaxed cell wall are incorporated between existing
                   hoops. Adding a make-before-break mechanism drives
                   division with a smaller constrictive force sufficient
                   to bring the midcell into a relaxed, but not
                   necessarily compressed, state.},

                   the suffix `cocci', which are the focus of this
                   review, different shapes exist. While staphylococci
                   or Neisseria cells, for example, are truly
                   round-shaped, streptococci, lactococci or enterococci
                   have an ovoid shape. Interestingly, there seems to be
                   a correlation between the shape of an organism and
                   its set of penicillin-binding proteins -- the enzymes
                   that assemble the peptidoglycan, the main constituent
                   of the cell wall. While only one peptidoglycan
                   biosynthesis machinery seems to exist in

                   implying that diverse mechanisms exist to coordinate
                   cell growth and division. Our knowledge about the
                   mechanisms controlling growth and division of cocci
                   is mainly derived from studies on the two model
                   organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus
                   pneumoniae.During growth, spherical cocci synthesize
                   peptidoglycan only at the division septum, catalysed
                   by one type of cell wall synthesis machinery, whereas
                   ovococci have two modes of cell wall synthesis
                   (septal and peripheral), which are possibly catalysed
                   by two different cell wall synthesis
                   machineries.Control of the S. pneumoniae oval shape
                   is orchestrated by a eukaryotic-type serine/threonine
                   kinase known as StkP. Several cell division proteins
                   are phosphorylated by StkP, which coordinates the
                   shift from peripheral to septal cell wall
                   synthesis.Chromosomal segregation in cocci seems to
                   be driven mainly by passive processes such as DNA
                   replication and transcription, as well as
                   entropy-based demixing of newly replicated DNA.
                   However, active, mitotic-like systems (such as the
                   ParABS and structural maintenance of chromosomes
                   (SMC) complex systems) are often encoded by cocci, so
                   they might also have a role.The spherical species S.
                   aureus divides in three orthogonal planes during
                   three consecutive division cycles. The directionality
                   of chromosome segregation, which is determined
                   through the action of a nucleoid occlusion effector,
                   dictates the placement of the division septum. In S.
                   pneumoniae, ParB, in combination with the SMC
                   complex, seems to facilitate the partitioning of
                   duplicated chromosomes to opposite cell
                   poles.Although the mechanisms involved in regulating
                   the growth and division of cocci are beginning to
                   emerge, future work is required to elucidate the
                   details of the processes involved.},

                   understood. In this article, we will discuss briefly
                   the current knowledge of how cell wall synthesis is
                   regulated, on multiple levels, from both sides of the
                   cytoplasmic membrane. According to the current
                   knowledge, cytosolic scaffolding proteins connect PG
                   synthases with cytoskeletal elements, and protein
                   phosphorylation regulates cell wall growth in
                   Gram-positive species. PG-active enzymes engage in
                   multiple protein--protein interactions within PG
                   synthesis multienzyme complexes, and some of the
                   interactions modulate activities. PG synthesis is
                   also regulated by central metabolism, and by PG
                   maturation through the action of PG hydrolytic
                   enzymes. Only now are we beginning to appreciate how
                   these multiple levels of regulating PG synthesis
                   enable the cell to propagate robustly with a defined

                   resolution of 3D-SIM (structured-illumination

  abstract =      {Bacteria display a variety of shapes, which have
                   biological relevance. In most eubacteria, cell shape
                   is maintained by the tough peptidoglycan (PG) layer
                   of the cell wall, the sacculus. The organization of
                   PG synthesis machineries, orchestrated by different
                   cytoskeletal elements, determines the specific shapes
                   of sacculi. In rod-shaped bacteria, the actin-like
                   (MreB) and the tubuline-like (FtsZ) cytoskeletons
                   control synthesis of the sidewall (elongation) and
                   the crosswall (septation) respectively. Much less is
                   known concerning cell morphogenesis in cocci, which
                   lack MreB proteins. While spherical cocci exclusively
                   display septal growth, ovococci additionally display
                   peripheral growth, which is responsible of the slight
                   longitudinal expansion that generates their ovoid
                   shape. Here, we report that the ovococcus Lactococcus
                   lactis has the ability to become rod-shaped. L.
                   lactis IL1403 wild-type cells form long aseptate
                   filaments during both biofilm and planktonic growth
                   in a synthetic medium. Nascent PG insertion and the
                   division protein FtsK localize in multiple peripheral
                   rings regularly spaced along the filaments. We show
                   that filamentation results from septation inhibition,
                   and that penicillin-binding proteins PBP2x and PBP2b
                   play a direct role in this process. We propose a
                   model for filament formation in L. lactis, and
                   discuss the possible biological role of such
                   morphological differentiation.},

                   Peptidoglycan is the major cell wall structural
                   polymer, whose synthesis requires multiple
                   interacting components. The human pathogen
                   Staphylococcus aureus is a prolate spheroid that
                   divides in three orthogonal planes. Here, we have
                   integrated cellular morphology during division with
                   molecular level resolution imaging of peptidoglycan
                   synthesis and the components responsible. Synthesis
                   occurs across the developing septal surface in a
                   diffuse pattern, a necessity of the observed septal
                   geometry, that is matched by variegated division
                   component distribution. Synthesis continues after
                   septal annulus completion, where the core division

                   Here we show that the bacterial actin homologue MreB

                   membrane-associated filaments that coordinate

                   an array of mutants, using specific lipid staining

  abstract =      {Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential macromolecular
                   sacculus surrounding most bacteria. It is assembled
                   by the glycosyltransferase (GT) and transpeptidase
                   (TP) activities of multimodular penicillin-binding
                   proteins (PBPs) within multiprotein complex
                   machineries. Both activities are essential for the
                   synthesis of a functional stress-bearing PG shell.
                   Although good progress has been made in terms of the
                   functional and structural understanding of GT,
                   finding a clinically useful antibiotic against them
                   has been challenging until now. In contrast, the
                   TP/PBP module has been successfully targeted by
                   {$\beta$}-lactam derivatives, but the extensive use
                   of these antibiotics has selected resistant bacterial
                   strains that employ a wide variety of mechanisms to
                   escape the lethal action of these antibiotics. In
                   addition to traditional {$\beta$}-lactams, other
                   classes of molecules (non-{$\beta$}-lactams) that
                   inhibit PBPs are now emerging, opening new
                   perspectives for tackling the resistance problem
                   while taking advantage of these valuable targets, for
                   which a wealth of structural and functional knowledge
                   has been accumulated. The overall evidence shows that
                   PBPs are part of multiprotein machineries whose
                   activities are modulated by cofactors. Perturbation
                   of these systems could lead to lethal effects.
                   Developing screening strategies to take advantage of
                   these mechanisms could lead to new inhibitors of PG
                   assembly. In this paper, we present a general
                   background on the GTs and TPs/PBPs, a survey of
                   recent issues of bacterial resistance and a review of
                   recent works describing new inhibitors of these
                   enzymes.},

                   Here we report electron cryotomographic
                   reconstructions of dividing Caulobacter crescentus
                   cells wherein individual arc-like filaments were
                   resolved just underneath the inner membrane at
                   constriction sites. The filaments' position,
                   orientation, time of appearance, and resistance to
                   A22 all suggested that they were FtsZ. Predictable

                   filaments in cells where the expression levels and
                   stability of FtsZ were altered supported that
                   conclusion. In contrast to the thick,
                   closed-ring-like structure suggested by fluorescence
                   light microscopy, throughout the constriction process
                   the Z-ring was seen here to consist of just a few

                   filaments to the cell wall, occasional straight
                   segments, and abrupt kinks were also seen. An
                   ?iterative pinching? model is proposed wherein FtsZ

                   structure removed by trypsin, a fragile soft layer
                   containing hexagonally packed subunits, and a rigid
                   layer penetrated by numerous holes. The two inner
                   layers were separated by a process of autolysis,
                   trypsin treatment, and gradient centrifugation. The
                   hexagonally packed layer was less dense, pink in
                   color, and it contained carotenoids, lipid, protein,
                   and polysaccharide. The lipid consisted of
                   odd-numbered as well as even-numbered fatty acids,
                   and the polysaccharide contained rhamnose and
                   mannose, but it did not contain heptose. The
                   ``holey'' layer was white and was composed of a
                   mucopeptide containing glucosamine, muramic acid, and
                   four main amino acids (glutamic acid, alanine,

                   contained phosphorus, glucose, and a trace of meso-
                   and ll-diaminopimelic acid. A white mutant, W1, of M.
                   radiodurans had no pigment or lipid in its walls, but
                   it contained small amounts of the ``hexagonal''
                   layer. The holey layer, constituting the bulk of the
                   wall, was similar in morphology and composition to
                   that layer in the pigmented strain. Lysozyme did not
                   remove the lipoprotein-polysaccharide component from
                   the walls of the pigmented strains, and the
                   hexagonally packed structure was not visibly
                   affected, except for change in a minor structure.
                   Most of the mucopeptide layer was solubilized by
                   lysozyme, but a structureless bag-shaped residue was
                   left. This residue contained phosphorus,
                   carbohydrate, and limited amino acids, but it did not
                   contain muramic acid, glucosamine, or ornithine.
                   Aqueous phenol removed a lipoprotein component from
                   strain R1, which contained limited fatty acids. It
                   also removed meso- and ll-diaminopimelic acid.},

                   of the complex are defined by in situ cryo-electron

                   \emph{Deinococcus radiodurans} is known as the

                   radiodurans}, consisting of several proteins on the
                   surface of the cellular envelope and intimately
                   associated with the outer membrane, has therefore
                   been useful as a model for structural and functional
                   studies. Its main proteinaceous unit, the S-layer
                   deinoxanthin-binding complex (SDBC), is a
                   hetero-oligomeric assembly known to contribute to the
                   resistance against environmental stress and have
                   porin functional features; however, its precise
                   structure is unknown. Here, we resolved the structure
                   of the SDBC at {$\sim$}2.5 {\AA} resolution by
                   cryo-EM and assigned the sequence of its main
                   subunit, the protein DR\_2577. This structure is
                   characterized by a pore region, a massive
                   {$\beta$}-barrel organization, a stalk region
                   consisting of a trimeric coiled coil, and a collar
                   region at the base of the stalk. We show that each
                   monomer binds three Cu ions and one Fe ion and
                   retains one deinoxanthin molecule and two
                   phosphoglycolipids, all exclusive to \emph{D.

                   characterization of the SDBC shows that it exhibits

                   envelopes contain one membrane (monoderms) or two
                   membranes (diderms). It is important to understand
                   how these and other variations that are observed in
                   the cell envelopes of prokaryotic organisms have
                   originated. In 2009, James Lake proposed that cells
                   with two membranes (primarily Gram-negative bacteria)
                   originated from an ancient endosymbiotic event
                   involving an Actinobacteria and a Clostridia (Lake
                   2009). However, this Perspective argues that this
                   proposal is based on a number of incorrect
                   assumptions and the data presented in support of this
                   model are also of questionable nature. Thus, there is
                   no reliable evidence to support the endosymbiotic
                   origin of double membrane bacteria. In contrast, many
                   observations suggest that antibiotic selection
                   pressure was an important selective force in
                   prokaryotic evolution and that it likely played a
                   central role in the evolution of diderm
                   (Gram-negative) bacteria. Some bacterial phyla, such
                   as Deinococcus-Thermus, which lack lipopolysaccharide
                   (LPS) and yet contain some characteristics of the
                   diderm bacteria, are postulated as evolutionary
                   intermediates (simple diderms) in the transition
                   between the monoderm bacterial taxa and the bacterial
                   groups that have the archetypal LPS-containing outer
                   cell membrane found in Gram-negative bacteria. It is
                   possible to distinguish the two stages in the
                   evolution of diderm-LPS cells (viz. monoderm
                   bacteria~{$\rightarrow~$}simple diderms lacking
                   LPS~{$\rightarrow~$}LPS containing archetypal diderm
                   bacteria) by means of conserved inserts in the Hsp70
                   and Hsp60 proteins. The insert in the Hsp60 protein
                   also distinguishes the traditional Gram-negative
                   diderm bacterial phyla from atypical taxa of diderm
                   bacteria (viz. Negativicutes, Fusobacteria,
                   Synergistetes and Elusimicrobia). The Gram-negative
                   bacterial phyla with an LPS-diderm cell envelope, as
                   defined by the presence of the Hsp60 insert, are
                   indicated to form a monophyletic clade and no loss of
                   the outer membrane from any species from this group
                   seems to have occurred. This argues against the

                   resistant to several stress conditions, such as
                   radiation. According to several reports, manganese
                   plays a crucial role in stress protection, and a high
                   Mn/Fe ratio is essential in this process. However,
                   mobilization of manganese and iron, and the role of
                   DNA-binding-proteins-under-starved-conditions during
                   oxidative-stress remained open questions. We used
                   synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence imaging at
                   nano-resolution to follow element-relocalization upon
                   stress, and its dependency on the presence of Dps
                   proteins, using dps knockout mutants. We show that
                   manganese, calcium, and phosphorus are mobilized from
                   rich-element regions that resemble electron-dense
                   granules towards the cytosol and the cellular
                   membrane, in a Dps-dependent way. Moreover, iron
                   delocalizes from the septum region to the cytoplasm
                   affecting cell division, specifically in the septum
                   formation. These mechanisms are orchestrated by Dps1
                   and Dps2, which play a crucial role in metal
                   homeostasis, and are associated with the D.

                   carried out by multi-protein machines that synthesize
                   and remodel the resilient peptidoglycan (PG) mesh and
                   other polymers surrounding cells. GpsB protein is
                   conserved in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria and is not
                   essential in rod-shaped Bacillus subtilis, where it
                   plays a role in shuttling penicillin-binding proteins
                   (PBPs) between septal and side-wall sites of PG
                   synthesis. In contrast, we report here that GpsB is
                   essential in ellipsoid-shaped, ovococcal
                   Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and
                   depletion of GpsB leads to formation of elongated,
                   enlarged cells containing unsegregated nucleoids and
                   multiple, unconstricted rings of
                   fluorescent-vancomycin staining, and eventual lysis.
                   These phenotypes are similar to those caused by
                   selective inhibition of Pbp2x by methicillin that
                   prevents septal PG synthesis. Dual-protein 2D and
                   3D-SIM (structured illumination) immunofluorescence
                   microscopy (IFM) showed that GpsB and FtsZ have
                   overlapping, but not identical, patterns of
                   localization during cell division and that multiple,
                   unconstricted rings of division proteins FtsZ, Pbp2x,
                   Pbp1a and MreC are in elongated cells depleted of
                   GpsB. These patterns suggest that GpsB, like Pbp2x,
                   mediates septal ring closure. This first dual-protein
                   3D-SIM IFM analysis also revealed separate
                   positioning of Pbp2x and Pbp1a in constricting septa,

                   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)

                   carbapenems (doripenem and meropenem) were
                   coselective for PBP1a, PBP2x, and PBP3, while six of
                   the nine penicillin compounds were coselective for

                   compounds tested display variability in their

                   (cefoxitin, cephalexin, and cefsulodin) and the
                   monobactam aztreonam exhibited selectivity for PBP3,
                   while only cefuroxime (a cephalosporin) was selective
                   for PBP2x. Treatment of S. pneumoniae cultures with a
                   sublethal concentration of cefuroxime that inhibited
                   60\% of PBP2x activity and less than 20\% of the
                   activity of other PBPs resulted in formation of

                   pneumoniae cultures with concentrations of aztreonam
                   and cefoxitin that inhibited up to 70\% of PBP3
                   activity and less than 30\% of other PBPs resulted in
                   no discernible morphological changes. Additionally,

                   distance between the two membranes is constant, ca.
                   33 nm. In Staphylococcus aureus the cell wall is ca.
                   40 nm wide. It is bordered on the cytoplasmic side by
                   an asymmetric 5.5-nm-wide bilayer. The bacterial
                   nucleoid, clearly visible with conventional
                   preparation methods, appears in exponentially growing
                   bacteria as an ill-defined central region with
                   approximately the same density as the rest of the
                   cytoplasm. It becomes more clearly visible when
                   bacteria are in the stationary phase, plasmolysed,
                   fixed, or stained. We confirm that "mesosomes,"
                   hitherto quite often considered to be essential
                   organelles in all procaryotes, are artifacts. They

                   assembled at the future division site during cell
                   division. While it is clear that the Z-ring plays an

                   precisely what its functions are and how these

                   bacteria call on an ancient homologue of tubulin,
                   called FtsZ, to localize and organize the cell
                   division machinery, the divisome, into a ring-like
                   structure at the cell midpoint. The divisome includes

                   homologue (FtsA), that interact with each other at

                   respond to stress, one of which is the rapid
                   large-scale reorganization of their nucleoid.
                   Nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs) are believed to
                   be major actors in nucleoid remodeling, but the
                   details of this process remain poorly understood.
                   Here, using the radiation resistant bacterium D.
                   radiodurans as a model, and advanced fluorescence
                   microscopy, we examined the changes in nucleoid
                   morphology and volume induced by either entry into
                   stationary phase or exposure to UV-C light, and
                   characterized the associated changes in mobility of
                   the major NAP in D. radiodurans, the heat-unstable
                   (HU) protein. While both types of stress induced
                   nucleoid compaction, HU diffusion was reduced in
                   stationary phase cells, but was instead increased
                   following exposure to UV-C, suggesting distinct
                   underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that
                   UV-C-induced nucleoid remodeling involves a rapid
                   nucleoid condensation step associated with increased
                   HU diffusion, followed by a slower decompaction phase
                   to restore normal nucleoid morphology and HU
                   dynamics, before cell division can resume. These
                   findings shed light on the diversity of nucleoid
                   remodeling processes in bacteria and underline the
                   key role of HU in regulating this process through
                   changes in its mode of assembly on DNA.},

                   crystal structures with solution x-ray scattering

                   nucleoproteins in solution under near-physiological
                   conditions. These macromolecular conformations and
                   interactions result in contraction at the cellular

                   nucleoid and reprogramming noninvasive Escherichia
                   coli into an invasive form. Collective findings

                   a tubulin superfamily GTPase, which is recruited to
                   the membrane by the actin-related protein FtsA. Both

                   peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes to the division
                   site. To understand how these components coordinate

                   which spans the cell envelope in the plane of
                   division. Assembly and activation of this machinery
                   are coordinated by the tubulin-related GTPase FtsZ,
                   which was found to form treadmilling filaments on
                   supported bilayers in vitro1, as well as in live
                   cells, in which filaments circle around the cell
                   division site2,3. Treadmilling of FtsZ is thought to
                   actively move proteins around the division septum,
                   thereby distributing peptidoglycan synthesis and
                   coordinating the inward growth of the septum to form
                   the new poles of the daughter cells4. However, the
                   molecular mechanisms underlying this function are
                   largely unknown. Here, to study how FtsZ
                   polymerization dynamics are coupled to downstream
                   proteins, we reconstituted part of the bacterial cell
                   division machinery using its purified components
                   FtsZ, FtsA and truncated transmembrane proteins
                   essential for cell division. We found that the
                   membrane-bound cytosolic peptides of FtsN and FtsQ
                   co-migrated with treadmilling FtsZ--FtsA filaments,

                   individual peptides showed random motion and
                   transient confinement. Our work suggests that
                   divisome proteins follow treadmilling FtsZ filaments
                   by a diffusion-and-capture mechanism, which can give
                   rise to a moving zone of signalling activity at the

                   layer is likely driven by the septal ring organelle.
                   Invagination of the outer membrane (OM) in
                   Gram-negative species is thought to occur passively
                   via its tethering to the underlying PG layer with
                   generally distributed PG-binding OM (lipo)proteins.
                   The Tol--Pal system is energized by proton motive
                   force and is well conserved in Gram-negative
                   bacteria. It consists of five proteins that can
                   connect the OM to both the PG and IM layers via
                   protein--PG and protein--protein interactions.
                   Although the system is needed to maintain full OM
                   integrity, and for class A colicins and filamentous
                   phages to enter cells, its precise role has remained

                   at constriction sites in Escherichia coli and that
                   mutants lacking an intact system suffer delayed OM
                   invagination and contain large OM blebs at
                   constriction sites and cell poles. We propose that
                   Tol--Pal constitutes a dynamic subcomplex of the
                   division apparatus in Gram-negative bacteria that
                   consumes energy to establish transient trans-envelope
                   connections at/near the septal ring to draw the OM

                   Z-ring that acts as a scaffold for accessory proteins
                   during cell division. Structures of FtsZ have been
                   previously solved, but detailed mechanistic insights
                   are lacking. Here, we determine the cryoEM structure
                   of a single protofilament of FtsZ from Klebsiella
                   pneumoniae (KpFtsZ) in a polymerization-preferred
                   conformation. We also develop a monobody (Mb) that
                   binds to KpFtsZ and FtsZ from Escherichia coli
                   without affecting their GTPase activity. Crystal
                   structures of the FtsZ--Mb complexes reveal the Mb
                   binding mode, while addition of Mb in vivo inhibits
                   cell division. A cryoEM structure of a double-helical
                   tube of KpFtsZ--Mb at 2.7\,{\AA} resolution shows two
                   parallel protofilaments. Our present study highlights
                   the physiological roles of the conformational changes
                   of FtsZ in treadmilling that regulate cell division.},

                   approach to carry out template matching on images.
                   When it is computed in Fourier space, it can handle
                   efficiently template translations but it cannot do so
                   with template rotations. Including rotations requires
                   sampling the whole space of rotations, repeating the
                   computation of the correlation each time.This article
                   develops an alternative mathematical theory to handle
                   efficiently, at the same time, rotations and
                   translations. Our proposal has a reduced
                   computational complexity because it does not require
                   to repeatedly sample the space of rotations. To do
                   so, we integrate the information relative to all
                   rotated versions of the template into a unique
                   symmetric tensor template -which is computed only
                   once per template-. Afterward, we demonstrate that
                   the correlation between the image to be processed
                   with the independent tensor components of the
                   tensorial template contains enough information to
                   recover template instance positions and rotations.
                   Our proposed method has the potential to speed up
                   conventional template matching computations by a
                   factor of several magnitude orders for the case of 3D

                   within the field of cryo-EM as the method for
                   obtaining the highest resolution structural
                   information of complex biological samples in-situ in
                   native and non-native environments. However,
                   challenges remain in conventional cryo-FIB/SEM
                   workflows, including milling thick specimens with
                   vitrification issues, specimens with preferred
                   orientation, low-throughput when milling small and/or
                   low concentration specimens, and specimens that
                   distribute poorly across grid squares. Here we
                   present a general approach called the `Waffle Method'
                   which leverages high-pressure freezing to address
                   these challenges. We illustrate the mitigation of
                   these challenges by applying the Waffle Method and
                   cryo-ET to reveal the macrostructure of the polar
                   tube in microsporidian spores in multiple
                   complementary orientations, which was previously not
                   possible due to preferred orientation. We demonstrate
                   the broadness of the Waffle Method by applying it to
                   three additional cellular samples and a single
                   particle sample using a variety of cryo-FIB-milling
                   hardware, with manual and automated approaches. We
                   also present a unique and critical stress-relief gap
                   designed specifically for waffled lamellae. We
                   propose the Waffle Method as a way to achieve many
                   advantages of cryo-liftout on the specimen grid while
                   avoiding the long, challenging, and
                   technically-demanding process required for
                   cryo-liftout.},

  abstract =      {100 kV is investigated as the operating voltage for
                   single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM).
                   Reducing the electron energy from the current
                   standard of 300 or 200 keV offers both cost savings
                   and potentially improved imaging. The latter follows
                   from recent measurements of radiation damage to
                   biological specimens by high-energy electrons, which
                   show that at lower energies there is an increased
                   amount of information available per unit damage. For
                   frozen hydrated specimens around 300 {\AA} in
                   thickness, the predicted optimal electron energy for
                   imaging is 100 keV. Currently available electron
                   cryomicroscopes in the 100--120 keV range are not
                   optimized for cryoEM as they lack both the spatially
                   coherent illumination needed for the high defocus
                   used in cryoEM and imaging detectors optimized for
                   100 keV electrons. To demonstrate the potential of
                   imaging at 100 kV, the voltage of a standard,
                   commercial 200 kV field-emission gun (FEG) microscope
                   was reduced to 100 kV and a side-entry cryoholder was
                   used. As high-efficiency, large-area cameras are not
                   currently available for 100 keV electrons, a
                   commercial hybrid pixel camera designed for X-ray
                   detection was attached to the camera chamber and was
                   used for low-dose data collection. Using this
                   configuration, five single-particle specimens were
                   imaged: hepatitis B virus capsid, bacterial 70S
                   ribosome, catalase, DNA protection during starvation
                   protein and haemoglobin, ranging in size from 4.5 MDa
                   to 64 kDa with corresponding diameters from 320 to 72
                   {\AA}. These five data sets were used to reconstruct
                   3D structures with resolutions between 8.4 and 3.4
                   {\AA}. Based on this work, the practical advantages
                   and current technological limitations to
                   single-particle cryoEM at 100 keV are considered.
                   These results are also discussed in the context of
                   future microscope development towards the goal of
                   rapid, simple and widely available structure
                   determination of any purified biological specimen.},

                   responses for open-ended tasks such as language

                   analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive

                   are highly prone to hallucinate content that is
                   unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a
                   large scale human evaluation of several neural
                   abstractive summarization systems to better
                   understand the types of hallucinations they produce.

                   allows obtaining the three-dimensional (3D) structure
                   of abundant macromolecular complexes, and can be
                   coupled with discrete classification to reveal
                   conformational heterogeneity of the sample. However,
                   the number of complexes extracted from cryo-ET data
                   is usually small, which restricts the
                   discrete-classification results to a small number of
                   enough populated states and, thus, results in a
                   largely incomplete conformational landscape.
                   Alternative approaches are currently being

                   comparison of the conformational changes for the
                   spike proteins as simulated in the hybrid model and
                   that isolated in solution as in the free form reveals
                   that the former is completely different from the
                   latter. The simulation results demonstrate the
                   necessity for the development of multiscale models to
                   study the functions of proteins in the biomolecular
                   complexes.},
