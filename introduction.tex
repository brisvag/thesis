\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\begin{outline}
\1 Importance of understanding 3D structure of molecules
    \2 Cryo-em's contribution to this, resolution revolution
    \2 some review, examples of breakthroughs thanks to structure findings (covid mention might be nice)
\1 Importance of context, mesoscale and superstructures
    \2 examples of SPA that cannot give insights
    \2 Cryo-eT and its power for this at high res
\1 Importance of visualization in interpreting complex data
    \2 hypothesis generation, testing
    \2 chanllenges due to complexity/dimensionality of data
    \2 need for real-time interaction
\1 D. radiodurans
    \2 why it's interesting (radiation resistance)
    \2 what we hope to learn (DNA repair, protection via wall, etc)
\1 Goal of this thesis
    \2 enable people to do powerful tomo on superstructures
    \2 apply these methods on biological system
    \2 Understand septation mechanisms of Deinococcus
\1 what each chapter is about (either here, or spread out trhough the previous bullet points)
