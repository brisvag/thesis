\chapter{Preface}

% This thesis is the result of interdisciplinary work at the interface of computer science, structural biology and image processing. The main focus is on the development of open-source, user-friendly and reusable software for the Cryo-ET [...]

I'm still unsure about having a Preface at all, I'm taking inspiration from other theses. This might also just fit into the introduction instead.

\begin{outline}
\1 masters -> gateway into structural bio, visualisation and development
\1 Overview of thesis
    \2 initial work on bacterial cromatin
    \2 napari, move onto development > blik
    \2 Dr. project (connection with initial project, interest in septation)
\1 nature of thesis (open source dev, collaborative work, less focus on single project/structure). Not sure if/how/where to do this, but it feels important to mention
\1 publications, projects, collaborations resulted from this work
\1 I'd like to have a general section about software practices, but not sure where
    \2 a case for user-friendliness (cryosparc > relion)
    \2 a case for open-source (relion > cryosparc)
    \2 a case for domain agnosticism (napari)
    \2 the benefits of modularity, "clean code", documentation, etc, to the research community
\end{outline}
