\chapter{FtsZ: structural insights}

FtsZ is a protein known to form ring-like structures at the septation site in most bacteria.


\begin{outline}
\1 Background on FtsZ
    \2 known features: ring formation, needed for proper septation
    \2 incomplete info: function, partners, filament structure
    \2 existing models
    \2 \cite{lutkenhausBacterialCytokinesisRing2012,szwedziakArchitectureRingFormed2014,fujitaStructuresFtsZSingle2023,sextonSuperresolutionConfocalCryoCLEM2022,liStructureFtsZFilaments2007}
    \2 various structures and how the align with models
\1 structural work
    \2 our work on SPA and filaments
        \3 technical difficulties: where to expand? (pref. orientation, filament picking, angles, classification, 3D rec...)
    \2 how this fits in with the rest
    \2 tomography + fluo from paper (depending on how much we already talk about this there)

\1 future perspective (probably go in discussion)
    \2 new data acquisitions
    \2 solving pref orientation
    \2 ideas for picking
\end{outline}
