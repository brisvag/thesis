\chapter{\textit{D. radiodurans}: cell division and septation}\label{drad}

This publication brings together conventional and super-resolution fluorescence imaging experiments performed by F. Lacroix and JP Kleman from the GenOM team and cryo-ET data acquired on FIB-milled lamellae of \textit{Deinococcus radiodurans}, to characterize the complex composition of this bacteriumâ€™s cell wall and its unusual mode of septation.
