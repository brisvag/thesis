\chapter{\textit{D. radiodurans}: cell division and septation}\label{drad}

This (unpublished) manuscript brings together conventional and super-resolution fluorescence imaging experiments --- performed by F. Lacroix and JP Kleman from the GenOM team --- and cryo-ET data from FIB-milled lamellae --- acquired by my supervisor I. Gutsche --- of \textit{Deinococcus radiodurans}, to characterize the complex composition of this bacterium's cell wall and its unusual mode of septation.

My contribution to this work is tightly coupled to the previous chapter (\fullref{blik}): the membrane annotation tool presented therein was developed as a way to systematically analyse the membrane profiles of \textit{D. radiodurans} --- as well as uniformly distribute particles for the later work on FtsZ (\fullref{drad_ftsz} and \fullref{ftsz}).
The cryo-ET data processing was also performed by me, through which I established and refined our group's tomography pipeline, consolidated by the batch processing tool waretomo I developed for this work~\cite{gaifasWaretomo2024} (\fullref{waretomo}).
