\chapter{\textit{D. radiodurans}: cell division and septation}\label{drad}

This manuscript brings together conventional and super-resolution fluorescence imaging experiments --- performed by F. Lacroix and JP Kleman from the GenOM team --- and cryo-ET data from FIB-milled lamellae --- acquired by my supervisor I. Gutsche --- of \textit{Deinococcus radiodurans}, to characterize the complex composition of this bacterium's cell wall and its unusual mode of septation.

\section{Addendum}

TODO: maybe need some setup for ftsz which we didn't include here.
