\chapter{\textit{D. radiodurans}: cell division and septation}\label{drad}

This manuscript brings together conventional and super-resolution fluorescence imaging experiments --- performed by F. Lacroix and JP Kleman from the GenOM team --- and cryo-ET data from FIB-milled lamellae --- acquired by my supervisor I. Gutsche --- of \textit{Deinococcus radiodurans}, to characterize the complex composition of this bacterium's cell wall and its unusual mode of septation.

TODO: expand a bit with the points below, or just jump into the paper?

\begin{outline}
\1 D. radiodurans
    \2 why it's interesting
        \3 radiation resistance, dna repair
        \3 different from typical (gram+/-)
        \3 relatively simple systems for stuff we were interested in (HU)
    \2 what we hope to learn (DNA repair, protection via wall, etc)
\end{outline}

\section{Addendum}

TODO: maybe need some setup for ftsz which we didn't include here.
