\chapter{\texttt{blik}: a cryo-ET visualisation and analysis tool}

Here goes a small preface to the paper itself (context in the rest of the thesis, what work I did vs what I didn't), where/when it was published, etc.

Also: add a chapter/section after this about other applications of blik by other people?

\localtableofcontents  % TODO: where exactly to put this?
\section*{\texttt{blik} is an extensible 3D visualization tool for the annotation and analysis of cryo-electron tomography data}  % TODO: actually make it into chapter title?
