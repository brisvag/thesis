\chapter[\texttt{blik}: a cryo-ET visualisation and analysis tool]{\texttt{blik} is an extensible 3D visualization tool for the annotation and analysis of cryo-electron tomography data}\label{blik}

A common thread throughout this thesis has been the need of developing custom tools for interacting with cryo-ET data.
During my first year, I encountered napari and its community of developers, which shaped significantly the direction of my work, and started the project of blik.

Here goes a small preface to the paper itself (context in the rest of the thesis, what work I did vs what I didn't), where/when it was published, etc.
