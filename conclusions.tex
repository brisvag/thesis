\chapter{Conclusions, Discussion and Future Perspectives}

The hardest part...

\begin{outline}
\1 usefulness of blik in working with data and developing new tools
    \2 especially good here to mention other projects that benefited from this work (either blik or related tools)
\1 new insights into D.rad
\1 evolution of field during thesis, new software, new people... new initiatives (some words on teamtomo maybe should go here as well!)
\1 scipion (need to finish that...)
\1 I'd like to have a general section about software practices, but not sure where
    \2 a case for user-friendliness (cryosparc > relion)
    \2 a case for open-source (relion > cryosparc)
    \2 a case for domain agnosticism (napari)
    \2 the benefits of modularity, "clean code", documentation, etc, to the research community
\end{outline}
